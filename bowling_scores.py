# Split the input string into a list of strings, using hypens as the delimiter
# A list of strings is needed due to the possibility of relevant zeroes
# in the most significant digit of an int,
# as well as the appearance of non-int data.
# It is far easier to convert from a text character to an int,
# as opposed to handling the errors from going the other direction.
